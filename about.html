                    <b>NaN Robotics Computing</b>
                    was incorporated with the ideology of teaching the young generation about STEM – Robotics, through something they will love, create and play. We want the children to know that their ideas and creations can be limitless. We want them to explore with what they have in mind and what they can create with their hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Robotics</b>
                    is a growing industry, and will become a fundamental part of our lives in the future. At NaN Robotics, we aim to use various Lego educational sets to provide children with the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of robotics. We are one of the few companies in Nepal offering such services, and it is our goal to provide the best opportunities for the children.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Our Programs</b>
                    are backed by World’s leader in Robotics Education, Researchers and Innovators, so children can benefit from them not just at special classes, but also in their schools and homes itself. The education system in Nepal is still traditional in many institutions, we hope our services will help to modernize the system. In the age of machine learning and AI, our children must familiarize themselves with the available technology.
